# Gas Regime Model

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to generate Figures 1–3 in journal paper.

## Contents
- `Figures_1_to_3.ipynb`: Synthetic data generation, regime classification using HMM, and optimal storage policy visualization.

## Figures
- **Figure 1**: Unified framework architecture showing data flow from market inputs through regime identification and spillover quantification to valuation outputs.
- **Figure 2**: Regime classification timeline on synthetic prices over 50 time steps, with three distinct periods.
- **Figure 3**: Optimal storage policies by regime, showing injection/withdrawal decisions across price-inventory space.
